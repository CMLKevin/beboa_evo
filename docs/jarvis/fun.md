## Customizing Fun Commands

### Add New Roast Lines

Edit `src/services/adminCommands.js`:

```javascript
const roastLines = [
    "Your taste is so bad, even I feel sorry for you.",
    "New roast line here",
    // Add more
];
```

### Add New Fortune Prophecies

```javascript
const prophecies = [
    "You will find what you seek, but it won't be what you wanted.",
    "New prophecy here",
    // Add more
];
```

### Adjust Compatibility Algorithm

```javascript
function calculateCompatibility(user1, user2) {
    // Customize factors
    const bebitsFactor = compareBalances(user1, user2);
    const streakFactor = compareStreaks(user1, user2);
    const randomFactor = Math.random() * 30;

    return Math.min(100, bebitsFactor + streakFactor + randomFactor);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it light** - Fun commands should never feel mean
2. **Rotate content** - Add new lines regularly
3. **Track usage** - See which commands are popular
4. **Community input** - Let users suggest roast lines
5. **Know your audience** - Adjust humor for server culture
